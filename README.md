# HO3D - scripts

<!-- <img src="logo.png" width="60%"> -->

HO3D is a dataset with 3D pose annotations for hand and object under severe occlusions from each other. The sequences in the dataset contain different
persons manipulating different objects, which are taken from [YCB dataset](https://rse-lab.cs.washington.edu/projects/posecnn/). Details about the 
proposed annotation method can be found in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.01481). The dataset contains 77558 annotated images and their 
corresponding depth maps.

This repository contains a collection of scripts for:
* Visualization of HO3D dataset
* Evaluation scripts used in the challenge
* Generate meshes
